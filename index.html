Pair programming is a style of programming in which two programmers work side-by-side at one
computer, continuously collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code or test. As discussed below,
use of this practice has been demonstrated to improve productivity and quality of software products.
Additionally, based on a survey(Williams 1999) of pair programmers (hereafter referred to as âthe pair
programming survey"), 100% agreed that they had more confidence in their solution when pair
programming than when they program alone. Likewise, 96% agreed that they enjoy their job more than
when programming alone.

However, most programmers are long conditioned to performing solitary work and often resist the
transition to pair programming. Ultimately, most triumphantly make this transition. This purpose of this
paper is to aid programmers in becoming effective pair programmers. The transition and on-going
success as a pair programmer often involves practicing everyday civility, as written about in Robert
Fulghumâs poem above. Each of the poem lines (some adapted with poetic license) will be explored for
the inherent lessons related to successful pair programming.

Anecdotal and initial statistical evidence indicates pair programming is highly beneficial. Extreme
Programming (XP), an emerging software development methodology, attributes great success to the use
of âpair programming.â XP was developed initially by Smalltalk code developer and consultant Kent Beck
with colleagues Ward Cunningham and Ron Jeffries. The evidence of XPâs success is highly anecdotal,
but so impressive that it has aroused the curiosity of many highly-respected software engineering
researchers and consultants. The largest example of its accomplishment is the sizable Chrysler
Comprehensive Compensation system launched in May 1997. After finding significant, initial
development problems, Beck and Jeffries restarted this development using XP principles. The payroll
system pays some 10,000 monthly-paid employees and has 2,000 classes and 30,000 methods,
(Anderson 1998), went into production almost on schedule, and is still operational today. Additionally,
programmers at Ford Motor Company, spent four unsuccessful years trying to build the Vehicle Cost and
Profit System (VCAPS) using a traditional waterfall methodology. The XP developers successfully
implemented that system in less than a year using Extreme Programming (Beck 1999).
XP attributes great success to the use of âpair programming.â All production code is written with a
partner. XP advocates pair programming with such fervor that even prototyping done solo is scrapped
and re-written with a partner. One key element is that while working in pairs a continuous code review is
performed, noting that it is amazing how many obvious but unnoticed defects become noticed by another

person watching over their shoulder. Results (Beck 1999) demonstrate that the two programmers work
together more than twice as fast and think of more than twice as many solutions to a problem as two
working alone, while attaining higher defect prevention and defect removal leading to a higher quality
product.
Two other studies support the use of pair programming. Larry Constantine, a programmer, consultant,
and magazine columnist reports on observing âDynamic Duosâ during a visit to P. J. Plaugherâs software
company, Whitesmiths, Ltd, providing anecdotal support for collaborative programming. He immediately
noticed that at each terminal were two programmers working on the same code. He reports, âHaving
adopted this approach, they were delivering finished and tested code faster than ever . . . The code that
came out the back of the two programmer terminals was nearly 100% bug free . . . it was better code,
tighter and more efficient, having benefited from the thinking of two bright minds and the steady dialogue
between two trusted terminal-mates . . . Two programmers in tandem is not redundancy; itâs a direct route
to greater efficiency and better quality.â(Constantine 1995)
An experiment by Temple University Professor Nosek studied 15 full-time, experienced programmers
working for 45 minutes on a challenging problem, important to their organization, in their own
environment, and with their own equipment. Five worked individually, ten worked collaboratively in five
pairs. Conditions and materials used were the same for both the experimental (team) and control
(individual) groups. This study provided statistically significant results, using a two-sided t-test. âTo the
surprise of the managers and participants, all the teams outperformed the individual programmers,
enjoyed the problem-solving process more, and had greater confidence in their solutions.â The groups
completed the task 40% more quickly and effectively by producing better algorithms and code in less
time. The majority of the programmers were skeptical of the value of collaboration in working on the
same problem and thought it would not be an enjoyable process. However, results show collaboration
improved both their performance and their enjoyment of the problem solving process (Nosek 1998).

The respondents of the pair programming survey gave overwhelming support for the technique. Says
one: âI strongly feel pair programming is the primary reason our team has been successful. It has given
us a very high level of code quality (almost to the point of zero defects). The only code we have ever had
errors in was code that wasnât pair programmed . . . we should really question a situation where it isnât
utilized.â Given these successes, let's review some principles of pair programming in the context of
Fulghumâs poem.

In pair programming, two programmers are assigned to jointly produce one artifact (design, algorithm,
code, etc.). The two programmers are like a coherent, intelligent organism working with one mind,
responsible for every aspect of this artifact. One person is typing or writing, the other is continually
reviewing the work. But, both are equal participants in the process. It is not acceptable to say or think
things such as, âYou made an error in your design.â or âThat defect was from your part.â Instead, âWe
screwed up the design.â or, better yet, âWe just got through test with no defects!â Both partners own
everything.
